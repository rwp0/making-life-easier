## This script allows Nginx server users to quickly and easily create new
## accounts. It takes in a username of your choice and the domain name that
## account will host. Script verifies that the username is valid and then
## takes care of creating the account, setting proper permissions and
## ownership of files and folders and uses a pre-made template to get
## Nginx set up as well.
